## GPU Install in Linux


- Check the instalation guide of tensorflow. It is very picky on the enviroment
- Install nvidia drivers before trying to install cuda
    - the cuda installer has also the drivers but apparently is more difficult to set up
- Download the .run file instead the deb file
- cuDNN is always required an it is a pain
  + this has to be installed with dev because it is IMPORTANT to install:
    - Runtime library
    - developer library
  
### pykeops
  - It needs cmake in the enviroment
  - Make sure this is in bashrc:


### Adding environment variables:

>>>  export PATH="/usr/local/cuda-11.2/bin:$PATH"
>>>  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
>>>  for WSL:
>>>  export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
>>>  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/wsl/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


Adding the path to bash is not enough for Pycharm. It has to be added to the enviroment variables. In ubuntu is on the file `/etc/environment`. Edit it with the following command `sudo -H gedit /etc/environment`.

You can check that the variables are properly set in Pycharm looking in the Run Config
